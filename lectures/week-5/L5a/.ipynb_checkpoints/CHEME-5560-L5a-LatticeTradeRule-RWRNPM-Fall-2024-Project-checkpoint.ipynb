    "### TODO: Visualize the cumulative distribution function of the fractional return\n",
    "The cumulative distribution function $F_{X}(x) = P(X\\leq{x})$ is defined as the probability that a random variable $X$ is less than or equal to a value $x$. In the sampling procedure above, we estimated $F_{X}(x) = P(X\\leq{x})$ for different values of $x$, i.e., for different values of the `minimum_target_return`. \n",
    "* This tells us the probability that our fractional return is less than a specified (desired) value. On the other hand, $1 - F_{X}(x)$ tells us $P(X>x)$, i.e., the probability that the observed return (random variable) `X` is greater than the minimum desired return `x`."
